# ruby_pvwatts

Provides a wrapper for NREL PVWatts v5 API. Currently only supports JSON format.
Usage:
You need to pass in an API Key, which is obtained from the NREL.
Additionally, you'll need to include a hash of at least the required parameters.
See http://developer.nrel.gov/docs/solar/pvwatts-v5/ for more information.

This is a work in progress and will have multiple updates coming soon.
